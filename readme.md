## Introduction

This project provides a Dockerized application for managing a simplified banking system, focusing on basic account management functionalities.

## Features

- Manages account IDs, user details, and current balances.
- Provides endpoints for retrieving account details and adding new accounts.
- Utilizes a JSON file for storing account data.

## Prerequisites

Before running this application, ensure you have the following installed:

- Docker: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Python (if running automation scripts): [Install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the Dockerized application up and running on your local machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone 
   cd bank_system_dockerization
   ```

2. Build the Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker build -t bank_system_image .
   ```

### Usage

1. Run the Docker container:

   ```bash
   docker run -itd --name bank_system_container -p 8000:8000 bank_system_image
   ```

   Replace `8000` with the desired port if your application uses a different port.

2. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Docker Operations

### Build Docker Image

To build the Docker image manually:

```bash
docker build -t bank_system_image .
```

### Run Docker Container

To run the Docker container:

```bash
docker run -itd --name bank_system_container -p 8000:8000 bank_system_image
```

### Stop Docker Container

To stop the running Docker container:

```bash
docker stop bank_system_container
```

### Remove Docker Container

To remove the Docker container (after stopping it):

```bash
docker rm bank_system_container
```
